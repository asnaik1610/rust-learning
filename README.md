# Learning Rust 🚀

This repository is my Rust learning space, where I practice core concepts using simple code examples with explanatory comments. The aim is to gradually build a strong foundation in Rust while keeping the notes clear, concise, and beginner-friendly.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust is known for:
- ⚡ **Performance** → as fast as C/C++, with zero-cost abstractions
- 🔒 **Reliability** → memory safety and fearless concurrency guaranteed at compile time
- 🛠️ **Productivity** → great tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, Clippy) and friendly compiler errors

## 📂 Structure
- `variables/` → Basics of variables, mutability, shadowing
- `ownership/` → Ownership, borrowing, references
- `functions/` → Function definitions, return types, closures
- `structs/` → Structs, methods, associated functions
- `enums/` → Enums, pattern matching
- `collections/` → Vectors, HashMaps, Strings

## ▶️ Running examples
Navigate to the concept folder and run:
```bash
cargo run
```
