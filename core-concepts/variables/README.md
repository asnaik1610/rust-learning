- The type system is the thread that **binds** an application
- Rust -> **strongly typed language**
- Variables are **statically typed**
- Even with type inference, a variable is assigned an inferred type, which will **never change**
- Rust is more flexible at inferring the correct type than other languages, including indirect inferences
- **Immutability** is The Default in Rust
- Memory is where data resides
- Variables are named memory storage, and they remove the need to reference data using memory addresses 
- A type describes the **memory layout of a value**
- Variable Binding is an important term in Rust
- *let* statement -> creates binding between a variable name and a memory location
- Rust supports **flexible binding**

## ðŸ“œThe following are the rules and naming conventions for variable names:
1. They are case-sensitive.
2. They consist of alphanumeric characters and underscore.
3. They cannot start with a number.
4. The naming convention is snake case.

- Variables must be initialized before using them in some manner

# Primitive Data Types
- basic types & building blocks of Rust
- are intrinsic
- implemented by Rust compiler
- functions & attributes of primitives are implemented in Rust libraries
